## What's Cookie Stuffing?
cookie stuffing (also cookie dropping) is an affiliate marketing technique in which, 
as a result of visiting a website, 
a user receives a third-party cookie from a website unrelated to that visited by the user, 
usually without the user being aware of it.
If the user later visits the target website and completes a qualifying transaction (such as making a purchase), 
the cookie stuffer is paid a commission by the target. 
Because the stuffer has not actually encouraged the user to visit the target, 
this technique is considered illegitimate by many affiliate schemes.  
 
There is more information about it: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cookie_stuffing)  

**We don't object to Affiliate links, we only object to implanting Affiliate links without reminding users.**
